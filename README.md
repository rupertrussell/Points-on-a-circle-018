# Points-on-a-circle-018
Circle packing using a method I devised that test for collisions at points on the circumference of each new circle. 

This method does not require an array to hold the location of each existing circle.
It is prone to some error depending on the number of points tested on each new circle.
The less points tested the greater the chance of missing an intercecting or overlaping existing circle.
